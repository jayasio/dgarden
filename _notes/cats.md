This is my first note. I wanted to write something profound, so here we go: **cats are cooler than dogs**. Kittens are cuter than puppies. Sure, dogs are nice and optimistic but cats are a mood.

For real though, [[Gardening]] is (sort of) the first note. It contains everything meta about this garden.
