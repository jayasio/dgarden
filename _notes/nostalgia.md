Nostalgia is this feeling of harking back to times when things were a certain way. It could either be within our own lives or sometimes, beyond. It is this specific combination of cues that reminds us of a certain time/space. Nostalgia lacks clarity, and the fuzziness is what gives it such an almost-there-but-never-will-be feel. Nostalgia can never be real because it is only an essence of pieces of perception that we pick up from reality.

Interesting is when someone tries to capture this feeling.
